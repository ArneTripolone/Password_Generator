# Password Generator

### Description:
This repository contains a random password generator. Much of the JS was sourced from Nazmus Nasir’s youtube channel, specifically the video
‘Easy JavaScript - Creating a Random Password Generator (54)’:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6cX05cyIgc . 
After much trial and error, this seemed to offer the simplest solution that was best able to merge with the existing HTML and CSS files. 
Unfortunately I was unable to add a workable checkbox for uppercase case characters.
